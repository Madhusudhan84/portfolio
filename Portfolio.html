    <h1>Info</h1>
    <p>The last month has seen me learn and practice web development, where I constructed six projects on basic levels, strengthening my grasp of the fundamentals. The projects include basic static pages to small interactive applications, from which I was able to get hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as basic responsive design and user interaction concepts. Each project was an improvement on developing problem-solving, debugging skills, and logical thinking, and learning to write clean and reusable code. With these projects, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also gained confidence in bringing ideas into viable web pages, which has encouraged me to work with more complicated ideas and larger projects in the future.</p><hr />
