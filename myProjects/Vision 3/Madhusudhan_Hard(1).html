<h1>How The Internet Works</h1><hr />
<h2>1.DNS</h2>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s phonebook, translating human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This process allows users to access websites without remembering long strings of numbers. DNS works through a hierarchy of servers—root, top-level domain (TLD), and authoritative servers—that work together to quickly resolve queries and direct traffic to the correct destination. It is a critical part of how the internet functions, ensuring seamless browsing and connectivity.</p><hr />
<h2>2.ISP</h2>
<p>An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides users with access to the internet through various technologies such as broadband, fiber, DSL, or mobile data. ISPs also often offer related services like email, web hosting, and customer support. They act as the gateway between a user’s device and the global internet, enabling online communication and browsing.</p><hr />
<h2>3.Server</h2>
<p>A server is a powerful computer that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network. Servers can host websites, store files, manage emails, or run applications, making them essential for communication and information sharing on the internet and in organizations.</p><hr />
<h2>4.Clients</h2>
<p>A client is a device or software that requests services or resources from a server over a network. Examples include web browsers accessing websites or email apps retrieving messages from a mail server.</p><hr />
<h2>5.IP adress</h2>
<p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing it to be identified and communicate with other devices. It acts like a digital address for sending and receiving data over the internet.</p><hr />
